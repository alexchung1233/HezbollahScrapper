Khomeini’s legacy has directly spawned or influenced major violent extremist organizations, including Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), as well as Lebanese-based terrorist organization and political party Hezbollah, and the more recently formed Iraqi-based Shiite militias, many of which stand accused of carrying out gross human rights violations.

Beginning on August 7, 1979, Iran has marked the last Friday of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan as Quds Day (“Jerusalem Day”), a day for Iranian leaders to make anti-Israel and anti-U.S. statements in front of crowds chanting “death to Israel.” Tens of thousands of people—many wearing bandanas emblazoned with the phrase “I love fighting Israel”—reportedly marched through Tehran on Quds Day in July 2016.

They are very much appreciative of the efforts that have been taken by Sudan,” el-Dardiri said. El-Dardiri did not elaborate on the timeframe, but U.S. charge d’affaires in Sudan, Steven Koutsis said Tuesday that if it is determined that Sudan met all the statutory criteria, the U.S is prepared to begin.

An army spokesperson said the military was confident that the tunnel existed and had penetrated into Israeli territory, but the IDF was thus far unable to locate a specific opening to it due to the rocky earth and recent inclement weather. ccording to the IDF, the tunnel originated in the Lebanese village of Ramyeh underneath a number of homes and crossed into Israeli territory near the village of Zarit.

Overnight, Hamas went from planning how to operate as a parliamentary opposition to President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah party to being asked by Abbas to form a cabinet and appoint a prime minister. But Hamas has a course to follow as it attempts to navigate the political waters between its rigidly conservative ideology, its stated intention to continue carrying out attacks, its need to actually govern, and Western calls for divorcing politics and violence. As it calculates how to balance these apparently competing interests, Hamas will look north to Lebanon's Hezbollah (Party of God) for a working model ofa militant Islamist group that balances its political, charitable, and violent activities.",https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/hamas-politics-charity-and-terrorism-in-the-service-of-jihad,Charitable

	Netanyahu has nevertheless articulated a set of red lines: the transfer via Syria to Hezbollah of game-changing weapons, specifically precision-guided missiles; and any attempt to open a new front in terrorist operations along the Golan Line of Separation, where Israel intends to maintain calm. Outside these red lines, however, Israel has taken no actions to degrade Assad’s power or threaten regime assets separate from the Iran-Hezbollah deployment in Syria. Both the Israeli security cabinet and the IDF General Staff have repeatedly rejected suggestions to equip certain non-jihadist rebel factions with the weapons they desperately need to fight the remnants of the Syrian army and the Iran-sponsored militias, at some 40,000 strong. This is despite pleas by rebel commanders for anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, heavy mortars, and light artillery. In the minority, a handful of Israeli security officials felt early on that by extending modest military assistance to vetted rebel groups in the Quneitra and Deraa provinces, they could help these fighters overcome the depleted units of the Syrian army’s First Corps, stationed at the nexus of Syria’s borders with Israel and Jordan, with Damascus to the north. The five Syrian army divisions traditionally posted in this area had suffered substantial casualties, defections, and a collapse in recruitment. For those Israeli officials who favored arming the rebels, the idea was to encourage their capture of this space and holding of the line along the southern approaches to the Syrian capital, areas that include the Assad strongholds of al-Kiswah, Qatana, and Kanaker. A strong rebel line in this territory would relieve pressure from rebel brigades active in other sectors surrounding Damascus and force Assad to split his much-weakened forces. Capture of southern Syria by the rebels, some suggested, would create a wide buffer zone between Israel and Iran-sponsored forces. Such a plan, however, never materialized owing to Netanyahu’s reluctance to get drawn into the Syrian quagmire and expose Israelis to retaliatory fire from across the border.",https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/bracing-for-an-israel-iran-confrontation-in-syria,Station

He sent U.S. ground troops into harm’s way twice in eight years: to invade Grenada, a country with roughly 500 troops, and to serve as peacekeepers in Lebanon, a mission he quickly aborted after a Hezbollah bomber killed 241 of them. The year after those interventions, as Paul notes, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger laid out a series of tests for military force—later popularized by Colin Powell—that essentially ruled out any intervention where public support, and decisive victory, could not be guaranteed. It was on that basis that in his final years in office, Reagan fended off members of his administration—led by a young assistant secretary of state named Elliott Abrams—who wanted to invade Panama. Even then, Reagan left the White House haunted by the belief that he had intervened too much.

Arsal,"Lebanese officials and security sources are deeply concerned for the fate of the captive soldiers as winter approaches and the battles between Hezbollah and the Nusra Front continue to rage into the border region where the hostages are thought to be held. Moreover, the sources told The Daily Star that ISIS and the Nusra Front are not taking the negotiations seriously, as their one true goal is to be given a free hand to use Arsal as a base and supply route.Meanwhile, developments on the ground in Syria, including the international campaign against ISIS, as well as Hezbollah's explosive surprise earlier this week, which wounded two Israeli soldiers, are factors that could alter the security situation and so need to be taken into account.  The government is unsure how to proceed, given the sensitivity of the captives issue, especially as ISIS and the Nusra Front have succeeded in inciting division among the Lebanese public, which affects the negotiations.

Ram,"
		One popular slogan was “We don’t want Iran, we don’t want Hezbollah, we want someone who fears God.” This may sound harmless to outsiders, but in Syria it was a clear call to Sunnis to rally against their enemies. During the summer of 2011, a bizarre rumor spread that if rebels banged on metal after midnight and uttered the right prayer during the holy month of Ramadan, Alawites would disappear. When I visited Aliaa’s home, she led me out to the balcony and showed me a terrace on the neighboring building. “You see that terrace?” she said. “They were banging on metal in the middle of the night. My father got out of bed and shouted: ‘Shut up! We’re not going to disappear!’ ”",https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/09/what-are-syrian-rebels-really/311424/,Home
