The IRGC-QF has played an active role in providing training and weapons to extremist groups including Iraqi insurgents, Lebanese Hezbollah, and others. The group’s commander is Major General Qasem Soleimani. In addition to overseeing the group’s violent attacks, Soleimani serves as an emissary of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, reportedly using a combination of violence and bribes to wield enormous influence over the politics of neighboring Iraq. He is also said to coordinate much of Iran’s support for the Ba’ath regime in the Syrian civil war.\n",

      "1 Iran helped create the terrorist group Hezbollah in Lebanon in the early 1980s in order to expand its influence in the region. Under the pretense of fighting foreign occupiers in Lebanon, Hezbollah has been responsible for murderous terror attacks against Israeli, American, and Jewish targets around the globe. Despite its rhetoric of freeing Lebanon from foreign occupation, Hezbollah has made no secret that it is heavily supported by foreign powers, namely the Islamist Iranian regime.\n",
      "\n",
      "2 Further complicating Hezbollah’s status, the terror group has woven itself into Lebanon’s social fabric, setting up charities and providing services in the southern part of the country where government authority is weaker. These social services have boosted Hezbollah’s popularity enough to allow it to become part of the Lebanese political structure. Since 1992, Hezbollah has had a presence and outsized influence in the elected government.\n",

For example, in 2004, Hezbollah provided $100,000 a month to the al-Janoub Hospital in the southern Lebanese city of Nabatiyah.  After the 2006 Hezbollah-Israel war, Lebanese citizens quickly forgot that Hezbollah instigated the conflict as the organization provided money for housing and welfare. “We have ideology and support. Our success can be seen in the peaceful existence between the Lebanese army and the military wing of Hezbollah,” said Hezbollah member Mohammed Ghosen.\n",

The anti-Hezbollah ruling Future movement saw a decrease from 33 to 21 seats, though its leader, Hariri, maintained his role as prime minister.

According to a mosque leader in Cuidad del Este, Paraguay, Shiite mosques had “an obligation to finance” Hezbollah.  Counterterrorism expert Edward Luttwak of the Pentagon’s National Security Study Group called the TBA Hezbollah’s most important base outside of Lebanon.\n",

      "9  In Syria, Hezbollah has capitalized on anti-U.S. sentiment and fear of Syrian government reprisals to recruit. In Lebanon, Hezbollah has invested in programs targeting every stage of Lebanese youths’ education, from primary school to university. Hezbollah runs networks of schools, camps, and religious programming throughout Lebanon. By targeting youth, Hezbollah gains new recruits and builds the domestic support responsible for its electoral successes.\n",

      "10 Hezbollah’s youth wing, the “Mahdi Scouts,” offers programs similar to those of the American Boy Scouts, except that it indoctrinates support for Shiite and Hezbollah ideology. Scouts display pictures of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the late leader of Iran’s Islamic Revolution, and pledge their allegiance to Hezbollah. Graduates go on to become Hezbollah recruits or contribute to local support. Hezbollah also runs summer camps, field trips, and religious holiday programing. It maintains student outreach groups in unaffiliated schools. A network of religious teachers across the country is charged with promoting Shiite values and Hezbollah’s mission.\n",
      "\n",
      "11  Hezbollah has since developed a network of training camps in Lebanon. It has also built a cultural machine that produces materials that foster an appreciation for Hezbollah’s patronage, its ability to empower Lebanese youth and support the society, and cultivate a deep distrust of Israel. The process of becoming a soldier continues at Mustafa schools, where students undergo religious studies, pray for Islamic Resistance fighters, and are inculcated with a sense of military brotherhood and discipline. As of 2011, Hezbollah did not allow fighters under the age of 18, but youth have a basic understanding of military training and weapons.\n",

These activated recruits join out of a sense of religious obligation, desire to resist occupation, and even peer pressure.\n",

At the same time, Iranian-backed militias such as Kata’ib Hezbollah sought to gain influence in Iraq by joining the insurrection. Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) emerged as a central actor in the insurgency, eventually expanding and changing its name to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), and began to seize territory in northwestern Iraq. After capturing Iraq’s second largest city of Mosul in June 2014, ISIS declared an Islamic caliphate in captured portions of Iraq and Syria. Within its captured territory, ISIS enacted brutal discriminatory laws against non-Sunnis, particularly Iraq’s Yazidi and Christian minorities. ISIS has also engaged in the widespread murder, kidnapping, and enslavement of these minorities, leading Amnesty International and other humanitarian groups to accuse ISIS of ethnic cleansing. In non-ISIS-held portions of Iraq, the group has engaged in suicide bombings, shootings, and other violent attacks targeting Iraqi government forces and civilians. Within its captured territory, ISIS has destroyed Iraqi cultural and religious sites, brutally enforced religious restrictions, and violently oppressed Iraqi minorities. (Sources: \n",

For example, the Iranian-sponsored Hezbollah al-Hejaz group is suspected of carrying out deadly attacks in Saudi Arabia, including the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing. The Iranian government has also armed Houthi rebels fighting against Saudi forces in Yemen and issued anti-Saudi statements, such as September 2016 calls by Khamenei for the global Muslim community to challenge the “heartless and murderous Saudis” for custodianship of Islam’s holiest mosques. Also that month, Khamenei condemned reported Saudi-Israeli meetings, accusing Saudi Arabia of stabbing the Muslim community in the back.

The Angolan government does not officially recognize Islam, and was even accused by international media of “banning Islam” in 2013 after authorities destroyed two mosques in the capital, Luanda, though they were only destroyed because they had been built without permits. According to the BTI Project, much of Angola’s public and state media portrays Islam as “un-Angolan,” foreign, and dangerous, and equates it with the threat of terrorism. However, there have been no reports of Islamic-inspired extremist activity in Angola to date apart from two U.S.-designated Hezbollah financiers who have operated or sought refuge in the country. One of them operated a business network in Angola for at least two decades after 1990, and another had reportedly found employment in the country as of 2017. Angola has so far remained free of extremist activity from regional Islamist threats such as Boko Haram, al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), and al-Shabab. (Sources: \n",

Much of this has to do with the compromise that led to the election of Michel Aoun as president in 2017, which gave undue influence to Hezbollah and its allies. Lebanese Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil recently stated that, had it not been for Hezbollah, Aoun — his father-in-law — would not have become president. That revelation shows just how closely Bassil’s Free Patriotic Movement is aligned with Hezbollah, even at the expense of other partners, including Prime Minister Saad Hariri and Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea, who backed Aoun. Hariri went against the wishes of his followers when he nominated Aoun as president and Geagea offered his support, drawing fierce backlash. Lebanon’s new cabinet is deeply unbalanced, with 18 of its 30 ministers affiliated with the Hezbollah camp. This raised concerns over the country’s future and stability, especially as the so-called Axis of Resistance — Iran, Hezbollah and Syria — claims victory in Syria.”\n",

The decision was announced by Lebanese foreign minister Gebran Bassil after he met his Iranian counterpart Javad Zarif in Beirut last week. “We want it [Lebanon] to be unified and we want Iran out” Mr Pompeo said. The US chief diplomat said the US is committed to a partnership with Lebanese authorities despite Hezbollah’s increasing influence. “We are partners with Lebanon to achieve a good outcome for the people of Lebanon” he said.

Hassan Nasrallah made the comment during a wide-ranging interview that lasted more than three hours with the Beirut-based Al-Mayadeen TV station. Nasrallah said Iran, Syria and Hezbollah could “at any moment” decide to deal differently with Israel's actions in Syria and hinted that Tel Aviv might be a target. Addressing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he said: “Be cautious. Don't continue what you are doing in Syria. Don't miscalculate and don't drag the region into a war or a major confrontation.” Nasrallah said circumstances in the region have changed as Iran and its allies, including his group, expand their influence in the region. This means any war can be on more than one front, Nasrallah warned. Israel has recently increased its attacks on suspected Iranian military targets in Syria, confirming such targeting in a shift from its longstanding policy of playing down or not commenting on its military activities in the war-torn country.”\n",

American officials are concerned Hezbollah will use the ministry to provide state-subsidized health care and patronage jobs to its supporters and possibly even its fighters, helping it endure punishing American sanctions that have made it difficult for the group to offer its usual social services to its Shiite Muslim base. “We call on the new government to ensure the resources and services of these ministries do not provide support to Hezbollah,” said a State Department spokesman, Robert Palladino. As the new cabinet coalesced on Thursday after nearly nine months of political deadlock, the assistant United States Treasury secretary for terrorist financing, Marshall Billingslea, warned Hezbollah that if it tried to “exploit these ministries to funnel money or undertake other activities in support of their terrorist agenda, then we will have significant concerns.”\n",

The strategy, unveiled by National Security Adviser John Bolton, is the first issued since 2011 when the Obama administration’s view of counterterrorism was focused almost exclusively on the threat posed by al Qaeda after the death of its founder, Osama bin Laden. The priority given to Iran this time around reflects President Donald Trump’s drive to contain Iran’s influence in the Middle East, curtail its ballistic missile program and backing of extremist groups and force it to the negotiating table by re-imposing U.S. sanctions. Iran was cited only once – on the penultimate page – of the 2011 counterterrorism strategy as an “active” state sponsor of “terrorism.” But the current document shows how the Trump administration has put Shi’ite Muslim Iran at the center of U.S. concerns, even as it keeps a focus on Sunni Muslim militant groups in Syria and Iraq. “In addition, the United States faces terrorist threats from Iran, which remains the most prominent state sponsor of terrorism, really the world’s central banker of international terrorism since 1979,” Bolton told reporters. “Iran-sponsored terrorist groups such as Lebanese Hezbollah, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad continue to pose a threat to the United States and our interests,” he said.”\n",

Criticizing Lebanon’s situation aims to defend it as we liked it.

However, any observer can see the depth of the catastrophic crises. Dysfunctional democracy Some laughable incidents somehow explain the extent of these calamities. For example, at a donors’ conference held for helping Lebanese economy, top officials from lending countries booked economy class air tickets to go to the conference venue while the borrowers ironically came on fleets of private planes. Some people protested the fact that Lebanese President Michel Aoun abused his powers since the presidency was allegedly behind managing these trips. However, such allegations were denied by the presidential palace, and it said that the president has been following the footsteps of his predecessors and there has been no deviation in policy or actions. When writing about the country’s several crises, one cannot overlook the internal political weakness as moderate liberal forces, the leftist parties that oppose Syria and Iran and Christian factions which have revolted against murderous parties have succumbed to the power of de facto, i.e. the fundamentalism represented in Hezbollah.”\n",
