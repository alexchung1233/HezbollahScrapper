	Two factors are driving these tensions: efforts by Hezbollah and Syria—with Iran’s help—to produce highly accurate missiles in Lebanon and Syria that could cripple Israel’s critical infrastructure and make life there intolerable; and Iran’s efforts to transform Syria into a springboard for military operations against Israel and a platform for projecting power in the Levant. Iran, however, while pursuing an anti-status quo agenda that has often brought it into conflict with Israel and the United States, has shown that it seeks to avoid conventional wars and consequent heavy losses to its own forces. Instead, it relies on proxy operations, terrorism, and non-lethal shaping activities. Yet it has occasionally been willing to venture high-risk activities that entail a potential for escalation. (Example: Iranian forces in Syria launched an explosives-laden UAV into Israeli airspace in February; it was shot down, but the incident sparked a round of clashes.)",https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/the-great-middle-eastern-war-of-2019,infrastructure
"
	The potential for yet another war—one of unprecedented scope and complexity—is an outcome of the Syrian civil war, which has enabled Iran to build a military infrastructure in Syria and to deploy its Shi’a “foreign legion” to Israel’s borders. War is now possible on multiple fronts and in far-flung theaters, fought on land, in the air, at sea, and in information and cyber domains by fighters from Hezbollah, Iran, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and even Yemen. The widened scope of a possible war will create new military options for Iran and Hezbollah, and stretch Israeli capabilities to their limits.",https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/the-great-middle-eastern-war-of-2019,infrastructure

	In past conflicts with Hezbollah, Israel focused on the organization’s military forces, its leadership, military specialists, and elements of the Lebanese infrastructure that facilitated its operations. In the next northern war, the dilemma of whether to prioritize action against immediate threats or enemy centers of gravity and critical enablers will be acute; substantial effort needs to be invested in identifying centers of gravity that can be targeted to hasten war termination on favorable terms.",https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/the-great-middle-eastern-war-of-2019,infrastructure
" Israel’s war aims would likely be shaped by how a war begins and its geopolitical context. Would Israel aim to degrade enemy forces and to demoralize them? Disrupt the cohesion of the axis of resistance? Discredit the enemy’s “resistance doctrine”? Destabilize Syria and/or Iran? Or simply reestablish deterrence and bring about a prolonged period of quiet? How many of these goals are attainable? Should Israel focus on Hezbollah and Nasrallah? On Lebanese infrastructure that facilitates Hezbollah’s activities? On Iran and IRGC head Soleimani? On the Shi’a militias? Or on the Assad regime? How much emphasis should be placed on targeting the enemy’s field forces, military infrastructure, leadership, and motivation/morale, and how should Israel prioritize and phase these efforts? Finally, how will Israel resolve the tension between the imperative to end its wars quickly in a way that restores deterrence—which will require it to inflict heavy damage on enemy forces that in many cases will be embedded among civilians—and its desire to avoid unnecessary escalation, as well as fulfill its obligations under the law of armed conflict?",https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/the-great-middle-eastern-war-of-2019,infrastructure
" Israel has always tried to avoid multi-front wars that require it to split its forces. A key unknown is whether Hezbollah or Iran would try to limit or expand a conflict with Israel. Would Hezbollah eschew a fight in Lebanon to preserve its military assets there, avoid widespread destruction to the country’s infrastructure, and avert a political backlash? Would Syrian forces actively participate in such a war? Would Iran encourage the Houthis to attack Israeli shipping in the Red Sea, or would the Houthis do so without being asked? Would Hezbollah and Iran launch terrorist attacks against Israeli interests from the outset of a war, or might they try to de-escalate a potentially devastating conventional conflict in the Levant in order to launch a less risky, low-intensity terrorist “war in the shadows” against Israeli interests worldwide? And might Israel threaten to bring the war to Lebanon or Iran in order to prevent further escalation and bolster deterrence?",https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/the-great-middle-eastern-war-of-2019,infrastructure
" Hezbollah has more than 100,000 rockets and missiles in Lebanon—sufficient to overwhelm Israeli defenses—though most are not very accurate. Iran has thousands more—though most cannot reach Israel. After seven years of civil war, Syria has relatively few missiles left—though it is trying to rebuild this capability. Hezbollah’s Lebanon-based rocket and missile force is the key to achieving truly strategic effects against Israel, and a basic assumption over the past decade is that in the next war on Israel’s north, Hezbollah will be the main participant. But this may not be the case, because that would invite massive Israeli air strikes and ground operations and lead to widespread devastation in Lebanon—an outcome Hezbollah will presumably want to avoid. And so its dilemma: how to exploit the potential of its rocket and missile force without destroying Lebanon or jeopardizing this strategic asset, which may be needed later in the war to counter Israeli escalatory moves. This may be why Hezbollah (with Iran’s help) is creating its own Syrian and Iraqi proxies to fight for it in the Golan—and why Israel is trying to disrupt some of these efforts.",https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/the-great-middle-eastern-war-of-2019,station

When Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and reimposed U.S. sanctions on Iran last year, there was good reason to be skeptical.

	Netanyahu has nevertheless articulated a set of red lines: the transfer via Syria to Hezbollah of game-changing weapons, specifically precision-guided missiles; and any attempt to open a new front in terrorist operations along the Golan Line of Separation, where Israel intends to maintain calm. Outside these red lines, however, Israel has taken no actions to degrade Assad’s power or threaten regime assets separate from the Iran-Hezbollah deployment in Syria. Both the Israeli security cabinet and the IDF General Staff have repeatedly rejected suggestions to equip certain non-jihadist rebel factions with the weapons they desperately need to fight the remnants of the Syrian army and the Iran-sponsored militias, at some 40,000 strong. This is despite pleas by rebel commanders for anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, heavy mortars, and light artillery. In the minority, a handful of Israeli security officials felt early on that by extending modest military assistance to vetted rebel groups in the Quneitra and Deraa provinces, they could help these fighters overcome the depleted units of the Syrian army’s First Corps, stationed at the nexus of Syria’s borders with Israel and Jordan, with Damascus to the north. The five Syrian army divisions traditionally posted in this area had suffered substantial casualties, defections, and a collapse in recruitment. For those Israeli officials who favored arming the rebels, the idea was to encourage their capture of this space and holding of the line along the southern approaches to the Syrian capital, areas that include the Assad strongholds of al-Kiswah, Qatana, and Kanaker. A strong rebel line in this territory would relieve pressure from rebel brigades active in other sectors surrounding Damascus and force Assad to split his much-weakened forces. Capture of southern Syria by the rebels, some suggested, would create a wide buffer zone between Israel and Iran-sponsored forces. Such a plan, however, never materialized owing to Netanyahu’s reluctance to get drawn into the Syrian quagmire and expose Israelis to retaliatory fire from across the border.",https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/bracing-for-an-israel-iran-confrontation-in-syria,station

	This September, a McClatchy article outlined the kidnapping of three American defense contractors in Iraq, noting how they were held for thirty-one days and tortured after being snatched in January.

The true culprits belonged to Saraya al-Salam (the Peace Companies, or SAS), a Shiite militia headed by influential Iraqi cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. It is still unknown if this was a warning to the United States from Sadr himself, a rogue move by a splinter group, or a sign of a larger Sadrist effort against American forces in Iraq. Yet the news likely came as a surprise to many observers given Sadr's high-profile focus on nonviolent political action in recent months, not to mention Washington's repeated attempts to engage him.

Taking into account Israel's manpower and technological advantages, this strategy focused on prolonging the fighting as much as possible, maintaining home-front attrition by firing rockets on Israeli population centers, and increasing the costs of IDF ground maneuvers in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah displayed this defensive mindset during the 2006 war when it hid rockets and fighters in elaborate networks of underground fortifications and areas of dense vegetation that Israeli officers dubbed ""nature reserves.""

Yet the low turnout suggests that many Shia stayed home—an unsurprising outcome despite their growing discontent with Hezbollah’s costly war in Syria. No unified anti-Hezbollah coalition emerged with a clear message to mobilize disaffected Shia.

	Perhaps the most important factor in Hezbollah’s victory, though, was growing sectarian rhetoric. Although many Shia criticized the group’s foreign adventurism in past years, these detractors became less vocal once the Assad coalition scored a string of major victories in Syria, which resulted in fewer Lebanese returning home in body bags, a steadily solidifying “land bridge” to Iran, and a heightened emphasis on Shia identity throughout the region.

In April, for instance, it brought more than a dozen international journalists on a tour of Lebanon's frontier with Israel. And in May, it turned over several of its Syria border observation posts to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF). Although this smooth handover and the ongoing cordial negotiations about more sensitive border locations might suggest increased LAF capabilities, they also point to Hezbollah's comfort with the level of coordination, communication, and deconfliction it has achieved with the army.

Later, in 1987, Khomeini pledged Iranian support for “all Islamic struggles of nations and courageous and Moslem young people.” Since then, Iran has continued to justify its adversarial role with the West and support for terrorism as resistance to Western imperialism and oppression. Indeed, Iran’s constitution enshrined Khomeini’s anti-imperialist views in a clause calling for “entrusting the destinies of the people to the people themselves” against “the system of oppression,” seemingly providing constitutional justification for supporting violent revolutionary groups.

"A prime example can be seen through Iran’s aid to Hezbollah. Khomeinist networks began infiltrating Lebanon in the 1970s ahead of Iran’s revolution in order to promote anti-shah activities unhindered. Despite the popular belief that Hezbollah was founded to repel the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, these cells laid the groundwork for Hezbollah a decade before the group officially formed.  Khomeini’s government created the Office of Liberation Movements (a precursor of the IRGC’s Quds Force) to liaise with foreign so-called revolutionary movements, beginning with these Lebanese networks. In 1982, the IRGC began providing financial and material support to Lebanese Shiite militants who later would form Hezbollah. (Sources: ",https://www.counterextremism.com/khomeinism,home

The same U.S. court later held Iran responsible for sponsoring Hamas’s 1996 Jerusalem bus bombings that killed Sara Duker of New Jersey and Matthew Eisenfeld of Connecticut.

Yet Hezbollah seems unsure if the estimated $700 million it receives annually from Tehran can feasibly be maintained in light of tougher U.S. sanctions, more of which are scheduled to be implemented on November 4. Likewise, if the growing tension between Iran and Israel erupts into a regional war, Hezbollah may fear that Tehran will be unable to fund the reconstruction of destroyed Lebanese towns as it did in the aftermath of the 2006 conflagration.",https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/why-does-hezbollah-want-lebanons-health-ministry,reconstruction

	Another concern stems from the fact that Iran has made regional military operations its number one priority. As a result, a greater proportion of its funding to Shia militias has been diverted to military activities, so financial support for Hezbollah’s social services networks has been curtailed, leading to significant cuts in services. Today, Hezbollah soldiers and their families are the primary beneficiaries of such services, leaving out many noncombatant members and outside supporters who once received this largesse but now face the prospect of salary cuts and downsizing.

Allied intelligence services detected the plot and linked it to an Iranian intelligence officer operating out of Iran's embassy in Vienna, Austria. And on Tuesday, the French government directly blamed Iran's MOIS civilian intelligence service for orchestrating the failed attack. Simultaneously, French authorities also conducted a raid against an Iranian-supported front organization in northern France. But why, specifically, is France upping the ante against Iran? Primarily, because France recognizes that Iran is laying the groundwork for new terrorist attacks in Europe.

	The U.S. State Department considers Iran the world's most active state sponsor of terrorism. Iran's direct mechanism for supporting and directing terrorist organizations like Lebanese Hezbollah, the Taliban, and countless anti-American Iraqi militias is a shadowy extraterritorial unit called the Qods Force. Its army of 200,000 organized, trained, armed, and motivated youth poses a significant threat to the American homeland and especially to U.S. forces stationed abroad.

	The U.S. government had little doubt about who was behind the 1984 attack, even before crime-scene analysis and sensitive source reporting began to flow in. Writing just days after the second embassy bombing, the CIA noted that “an overwhelming body of circumstantial evidence points to the Hizb Allah, operating with Iranian support under the cover name of Islamic Jihad.” For one thing, the suicide vehicle bomb employed had become a trademark of the group. And, the CIA added at the time, “Shia fundamentalists are the only organized terrorists in Lebanon likely to willingly sacrifice their lives in such an attack.” Following the bombing, two callers claimed responsibility in the name of Hezbollah’s Islamic Jihad Organization (IJO). Several times in the year to follow, the CIA noted, anonymous callers in Beirut warned that the IJO planned to continue attacking U.S. interests. FBI forensic investigators determined that the marine barracks bombing was not only the deadliest terrorist attack then to have targeted Americans, it was also the single-largest non-nuclear explosion on earth since World War II. Composed of at least 18,000 pounds of explosives— the equivalent of six tons of dynamite— the bomb demolished the four-story building on the fringe of the Beirut Airport campus, leaving behind a crater at least 13 feet deep and 30 feet wide. So many marines, sailors, and soldiers perished that day that the base ran out of body bags. At the French MNF building, the deaths of 58 French paratroopers marked the French military’s highest death toll since the Algerian war ended in 1962. The eight-story building where the paratroopers were staying was literally upended by the blast.",https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/the-origins-of-hezbollah,airport

	But over time Fadlallah’s relationship with Iran changed. Fadlallah never fully embraced the Iranian revolutionary concept of velayat-e faqih (rule of the jurisprudent), which, according to a 1986 U.S. intelligence report, “virtually equates Khomeini with the Mahdi— the 12th Imam who is in occultation.” As much as Fadlallah sought an Islamic state in Lebanon, U.S. intelligence analysts concluded he also recognized the need to maintain the country’s religious diversity within an Islamic context. But other, more radical voices within Hezbollah, like the up-and-coming security official Hassan Nasrallah, the CIA warned, promoted a maximalist program in which an Islamic republic in Lebanon would presage a pan-Islamic movement spanning the entire Muslim world. “In our view,” the analysts wrote in 1988, “Nasrallah does not represent the mainstream of the movement.” Four years later Nasrallah would rise to the leadership of Hezbollah, moving the group’s mainstream sharply to the right.",https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/the-origins-of-hezbollah,home

	Speaking at the UN General Assembly on September 27, Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu accused Hezbollah of building missile production sites in the Ouzai neighborhood of Beirut. The group reportedly intends these underground facilities—located in the middle of an urban area near mosques, homes, schools, and the international airport—to convert regular missiles into more accurate precision weapons. It is unclear whether they are already operational or not.",https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/hezbollahs-urban-missile-factories-put-civilians-at-risk,mosque
"
	The Beirut revelation is not the first time Hezbollah has been caught using Lebanese civilians as human shields for weapons or production facilities. In July 2017, for example, Israel released aerial photos of southern village locations where the group had built a rocket factory and arms warehouse. One of the structures was located about 110 meters from a pair of mosques. The IDF reported at the time that Hezbollah routinely places rocket launch sites and other firing positions in the middle of populated areas, along with “a network of underground tunnels beneath civilian homes and structures to allow its fighters to move freely between posts.”",https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/hezbollahs-urban-missile-factories-put-civilians-at-risk,mosque
"
	Likewise, the group often placed military infrastructure near civilians during the 2006 Lebanon war. In the southern Shia village of Qana, for instance, photographs from the conflict showed an arms warehouse directly across the street from a mosque. And about thirty squads of Hezbollah fighters operated in the village of Aita al-Shab, many based inside houses.",https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/hezbollahs-urban-missile-factories-put-civilians-at-risk,mosque
"
	The group understands how dangerous this tactic is to their countrymen. In fact, it deliberately used sensitive civilian sites as military facilities during the 2006 war with the understanding that they would be attacked, apparently believing that this would increase the difficulty of Israeli operations in southern Lebanon. When detained Hezbollah soldier Muhammad Abd al-Hamid Srour was asked afterward if he knew that firing a missile at an Israeli tank from a civilian house would lead to the home’s destruction, he replied that firing was still “in the general Islamic interest,” and “that if the house was destroyed, it would simply be rebuilt after the war.” His claim that all homes were supposed to be evacuated before the fighting began seems like dubious comfort to those affected, even if true.",https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/hezbollahs-urban-missile-factories-put-civilians-at-risk,house
"
	Hezbollah recognizes that the growing signs of another conflict with Israel could stunt such developments. Moreover, if war breaks out, the Lebanese people likely know that they would receive much less reconstruction funding from Gulf Arab states than they did after the previous war, due to both heightened Sunni-Shia tensions and donor fatigue. This seems like a sobering realization given the wide upscaling of Hezbollah’s arsenal and forces, which would heighten the expected destruction of the next war and push the reconstruction process well past the seven years the group admitted were necessary to recover from the last one. In short, the Shia feel they have much more to lose today, so they have less tolerance for officials who talk of war with Israel.",https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/hezbollahs-urban-missile-factories-put-civilians-at-risk,development
"
	In light of this attitude change, publicly exposing Hezbollah’s missile factories may be the most effective way of exploiting rifts within the group’s base and, perhaps, making it think twice about building weapons inside Lebanon. When Netanyahu revealed the exact locations of the Beirut sites, the people living near them—mostly Shia civilians who support Hezbollah—had ample cause to worry that Israel may bomb the facilities at some point, potentially damaging their homes and killing their loved ones in the process.",https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/hezbollahs-urban-missile-factories-put-civilians-at-risk,home
"
	In addition, Iran’s support of Hezbollah missile development directly violates UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war and mandated “no sales or supply of arms and related materiel to Lebanon except as authorized by its Government.” Hezbollah would have trouble exploiting that exception given that Washington, Europe, and key Arab states regard it as wholly or partly a terrorist organization.",https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/hezbollahs-urban-missile-factories-put-civilians-at-risk,development
"
	The Security Council and wider international community should therefore consider strengthening and enforcing Resolution 1701, whether through the Lebanese government or in line with Chapter 7 of the UN Charter. A good first step is to mandate international oversight of Beirut’s airport, which could include monitoring flights and inspecting cargo to ensure no weapons or related parts are flown in to Hezbollah.",https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/hezbollahs-urban-missile-factories-put-civilians-at-risk,airport

"Which brings us to a second question, one having to do with the nature of the man considering military action: would Netanyahu, a prime minister with an acute understanding of the essential role America plays in securing the existence of Israel (Netanyahu is a graduate of both Cheltenham High School, outside Philadelphia, and MIT, and is the most Americanized prime minister in Israel’s history, more so even than the Milwaukee-raised Golda Meir), actually take a chance on permanently alienating American affection in order to make a high-risk attempt at stopping Iran? If Iran retaliates against American troops in Iraq or Afghanistan, the consequences for Israel’s relationship with America’s military leadership could be catastrophic. (Of course, Netanyahu would be risking more than his relationship with the United States: a strike on Iran, Israeli intelligence officials believe, could provoke all-out retaliation by Iran’s Lebanese subsidiary, Hezbollah, which now possesses, by most intelligence estimates, as many as 45,000 rockets—at least three times as many as it had in the summer of 2006, during the last round of fighting between the group and Israel.)

"I don’t. The problem is, you’ve got an actor like ISIS, like Hezbollah, like Hamas, like AQAP, indeed like a lot of other violent non-state actors, and they don’t just do terrorism, they do a lot of different things. So by saying that they are “a terrorist organization,” you’re lumping together, first of all, so many disparate organizations, and second, you’re obscuring the fact that they might hold territory, like ISIS, or Hezbollah for that matter, or, in some instances, AQAP. And you’re obscuring the fact that they do other things, like sometimes they provide social services. So, if it’s a group that does nothing but terrorism, by and large, I think that the name fits. An example of that is the Abu Nidal organization in the ’70s and ’80s. It’s a Palestinian group, small, and that was all they did was organize acts of terrorism, they didn’t do anything else.

"It

 small Gulf states, will do whatever they can to insulate themselves 
from the revolutionary and counterrevolutionary fray. In the second, 
Egypt and Tunisia will struggle to realize their revolutionary promise 
and ideals while resisting the counterrevolutionary forces of the old 
regimes. And, finally, there is the consortium of Saudi Arabia, Syria, 
Yemen (if President Saleh somehow manages to hold on), Algeria, Bahrain,
 and even an outlaw Libya, that all work -- not necessarily in concert 
--to contain and rollback democratic change. There have always been 
fissures and schisms among the Arab states, but never along these issues
 and alignments. The Middle East's two heavyweights -- revolutionary, 
struggling-to-be-democratic Egypt and status quo Saudi Arabia -- are 
likely to find one other at odds on a range of important issues 
including Hamas, Iran, Hizballah, and political change around the 
region. It is also possible that Egyptians, empowered by their 
revolution, will seek to support democracy activists elsewhere in the 
region. Many have already crossed the Libyan border in aid of the rebels
 there. Could they next turn their attention to, for example, Syria? 
Tunisians might seek to do the same in Algeria and Libya. This is not

"This book will be read carefully in Tehran, Washington, and Tel Aviv. Pollack lays out the strategic factors the United States must take into account when deciding how to deal with Iran’s nuclear program, covering nearly all contingencies, including military action. He argues forcefully that, should negotiations fail, Washington should opt for containment instead of military action. His case is lucid and compelling; he reminds readers that a U.S. air campaign that failed to set back Iran’s nuclear development for more than several years would probably lead to a U.S. ground invasion that would make the Iraq war look relatively simple. More provocatively, Pollack advocates combining containment with efforts at regime change, arguing that Iran does not moderate when the pressure is off but rather when it is high. He dismisses the idea that so long as Iran’s supreme leader believes the United States seeks to end the Islamic Republic, he and his supporters will have little incentive to reach agreement with Washington on the nuclear issue. Iran, Pollack argues, is aggressive but rational. It would not use nuclear weapons unprovoked. It would not share them with third parties such as Hezbollah.

Yes, but only after Hamas ceases to exist; after Yasir Arafat dies a natural death; after the PA recognizes Israel and Jews and allows Jews to live in peace wherever they live, even within their bloodstained, extorted new nation; after Syria stops supporting Hizbollah; and after our friends the Saudis stop fomenting hatred and financing and housing terrorists.

"A balanced, scholarly assessment of Islamic politics. By placing Islam in its historical and comparative context, Brown (this magazine's Middle East book reviewer) convincingly demonstrates that ""fundamentalist"" thought is a radical deviation from Islam's earlier political quietism. Although he regrets this development and wishes that Islamists would display greater tolerance toward fellow Muslims, Brown's argument is far from polemical. Some readers might wish for more details on the upheavals of the past two decades, and some may argue that the author's focus on four influential thinkers -- Hasan al-Banna, Abul Ala Mawdudi, Sayyid Qutb, and Ayatollah Khomeini -- inadequately represents the range of current Sunni and Shi'a thinking. But his survey of Islamic ideas and practice is confident and lucid, making sense of the current invocations of jihad, the ""Islamic state,"" and such movements as Hamas and Hezbollah. He is also instructive on the subject of Muslim political engagement, which he sees as not simply a matter of doctrine but also of evolving circumstance, shared history, and normative frameworks. The Islamic approach to politics is thus neither preordained nor unique but ""distinctive."" Such a nuanced view avoids the stereotyping of political Islam that has often skewed recent interpretations, and it provides a valuable lesson: Islam is not as determining as both Western critics and Islamists themselves would contend, yet it remains an important feature of the Muslim political landscape. A subtle and skilled rejoinder to the conventional schools of thought -- and to fashionable assumptions about the ""post-Islamist"" era.",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2000-09-01/religion-and-state-muslim-approach-politics,school
"In March 1984, Hezbollah fighters abducted William Buckley, the CIA station chief in Beirut. They held him prisoner until June 1985, when he died of torture and neglect. Buckley, who had served in the Korean War before embarking on a long and distinguished career with the CIA, rose to the position of Beirut station chief after the bombings of the U.S. embassy and the Marine barracks there. His nemesis was Imad Mughniyeh, Hezbollah’s master hit man, who was himself blown up by a car bomb in Damascus in 2008. The authors of this account of Buckley’s murder seek to honor his memory and openly thirst to avenge his death.

The book traces the mostly Iranian initiatives for a “grand bargain” with the West and the Bush administration’s decision to eschew that course in favor of destabilization and regime change.

The next chapter treats seamlessly such diverse matters as the economy, Iran's young population, the massive ""brain drain,"" and the role of students and women. There is even a consideration of what might be dubbed the evolving politico-theological role of the supreme leader and the regional assets and liabilities of Iran as a Shiite polity.

"Three ""myths"" and a tripartite approach to transcending them frame this book. The ""core mythology"" is that all Middle Eastern issues are linked to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The second myth concerns ""larger themes of engagement versus nonengagement and regime change versus the change of regime behavior."" And the third myth relates to the question of democracy promotion. For each of the three, Ross (now serving in the Obama administration) and Makovsky present a Goldilocks solution in which the neoconservative's approach is too hot, the realist school's is too cold, and theirs is just right. Even while dissociating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from other problems, the authors demonstrate linkages galore and stress the importance of resolving it. Surely, the old adage that in the Middle East everything is linked to everything else offers a better road map than denying any linkage between Israel and other issues. In addressing their second myth, the authors deal mainly with Iran and what are seen as its satellites, Hezbollah and Hamas, with Israel again very much in the picture. With the final section on democracy promotion including a separate chapter lauding U.S.-Israeli ties, the thrust of this book seems to offer yet another triad: the United States has only one true ally in the Middle East, Israel; its Arab friends are, alas, generally despotic and feckless; and its enemies are legion -- Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah, and al Qaeda.",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2009-09-01/myths-illusions-and-peace-finding-new-direction-america-middle,school

Hezbollah proudly acknowledges receiving support from Iran and Syria and would be weaker without it, but the group is too deeply rooted in Lebanon to be the tool of any outsider.

A short historical sketch of the emergence of Hezbollah is followed by a presentation of the group's religio-political ideology, which includes acceptance of the velayat (guardianship) of the Iranian faqih (first Khomeini and then Khamenei). Thereafter, with copious charts and tables, Hamzeh presents Hezbollah's organizational structure, its social service activities, its terrorist and military acts over the years, and its political role in Lebanon. At the same time, he addresses the larger question of concern to all: Can an armed organization that has militant, terrorist roots and is bent on establishing an Islamist state evolve into a play-by-the-rules actor in a pluralistic polity? Hezbollah, Hamzeh concludes, truly believes in the possibility of eventually achieving its Islamic republic (thanks to the inexorable demographic weapon) but has shown remarkable pragmatism and adaptability en route to that goal. Thus, prudent policies pushed by others both from within Lebanon and beyond just might tie it to pluralistic politics and keep its Islamist dream at bay.",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2005-11-01/path-hizbullah,home

  This is also happening here in the United States, with megachurches. But it’s especially pronounced in the developing world. Those of us who report outside of America, are seeing more and more religious awakenings patterning people’s daily lives in ways that are hard for many of us at home to understand. Perceived slurs and slights, or massive conflagrations—like the war in Iraq, or the situation in Israel and Palestine—have a profound impact on how people hold onto their religious and cultural identity. One example: during the war in Lebanon several summers ago, I was in Kano, a town in northern Nigeria. If you wanted to watch the news, you watched either blonde Hala Gorani on CNN or marching music videos on Hezbollah TV.

"Even as America worries about Iraq's Shiite-Sunni divide, a similar fault line threatens Saudi Arabia, according to a new report from the International Crisis Group. The kingdom's two million Shiites account for only 10 to 15 percent of the population, but they are concentrated in the Eastern Province, which is close to Iraq and home to the country's largest oil fields and processing facilities. Saudi Arabia's Sunni monarchs have long pursued policies intended ""simultaneously to pacify and marginalize"" the Shiite population: encouraging Sunnis to resettle in the Eastern Province, seizing the property and merchandise of Shiite merchants, and imposing restrictions on Shiite religious observances. Shiite clerics have generally responded by urging distance from political matters and quiet, gradual attempts to bring about reform. The report notes, however, that a Saudi branch of Hizbollah was founded in 1987 and continues to operate, and that thirteen Saudi Shiites were indicted for their alleged role in the 1996 bombing of the Khobar Towers. It adds that many Saudi Sunnis think their Shiite countrymen are ""biding their time, banking on external support—U.S. or other—to establish their own independent state.""

"The news came on November 4 in the form of three back-to-back developments in a mere 10 hours. First, Saad Hariri, Lebanon’s prime minister, announced his resignation. That he made the statement from Riyadh told much of the story; that he delivered it with the genuineness of one forced to read his own prison sentence told the rest. The decision was announced by the Lebanese prime minister but it was made in Saudi Arabia. Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince and de facto leader, had reason to want it to happen. Saudi-Iranian tensions are rising and bin Salman is determined to depict Tehran as the source of all regional evils.

"Hezbollah is, of course, genuinely popular within the Shia community. Its message that it has protected the country against threats, both from Israel and from Syrian jihadists alike, rings true for many of its voters, who also see Nasrallah as devoid of corruption, unlike the rest of the crooked political establishment. But the political resources at Hezbollah’s disposal, which include a construction arm and a foundation to support families whose sons have been killed fighting under its flag, dwarf those of the other parties. The weakness of the Lebanese state also provides Hezbollah with a trump card, allowing it to portray itself as the only power that can protect its supporters from internal and external enemies. These accumulated advantages have left those running against the party to question whether there is any governance failure large enough to cause Hezbollah to lose an election. “They’re using the sectarian card, they’re trying to bring all the Shia together to follow them,” Yaghi said. “They’re taking people who are hungry and paying them, and they have weapons and money that nobody else has.”",https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/05/lebanon-election-hezbollah-sunni-shia/559772/,construction

While the Fateh-110 is not yet a precision missile, it is undoubtedly a more accurate weapon. Hajj Mohammed’s unguided rockets, if fired at Tel Aviv, would be just as likely to hit a point within 3.6 kilometers of his target as to land outside that zone.

Hezbollah ended up in a full-scale war, in which it won some battlefield  victories and popularity in the Arab and Muslim world but which devastated its Lebanese Shiite  constituency and narrowed its tactical and political options. Israel, despite unleashing massive  airpower on Hezbollah strongholds, failed to knock out the organization or even to stop its missile  attacks, while the setbacks suffered by Israel's ground invasion had the effect of puncturing  the aura of invincibility long projected by the Israel Defense Forces. Tehran reaped some benefit  from Hezbollah's increased popularity and perhaps can point to the organization's robust performance  as a warning to those considering military action against Iran, but this war wasted much of the deterrent  power that it had vested in Hezbollah for its own hour of need. Meanwhile, the United States looked  on helplessly as the crisis drove Arab and Muslim public opinion further against it and weakened  an already fragile Lebanon.

At the same time, the Iraqi President was observed to be repairing his links to other leading terrorists—George Habbash, Nayef Hawatmeh, Ahmed Jibril, and the organization Hizbollah, fifteen of whose members Saddam Hussein brought back to Iraq from a Kuwaiti prison after Iraq invaded.

"Hezbollah is known for its cult of martyrdom, but also for providing a range of social services, like hospitals and schools. Two researchers think that those services are a key to the group’s success—and to its deadliness. Like many other terror outfits, including Hamas and the Taliban, Hezbollah works like a club, requiring membership dues in the form of religious observances. The authors point out that in the shadow war of insurgency, such clubs face no greater danger than defection. The groups protect themselves by encouraging extreme “signals” of religious loyalty among their members, like tight dietary restrictions and material sacrifice. This loyalty is reinforced when the club provides benefits like education, health care, and security. With less fear of defection, clubs can more confidently attack high-value targets and are more likely to use suicide bombers. The authors note that Hamas, which offers social services to Palestinians, averages 5.9 fatalities per attack. Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which shares Hamas’s jihadist ideology but not its commitment to welfare, averages only 2.9. Hezbollah kills 5.0 people per strike—a far higher rate than for any group that fails to provide for its followers.

The problem with the agreement has to do with enforcement of these “safe zones.” Who determines what groups get to enter or exit, and if violence breaks out, who enforces a return to the ceasefire? Two of the biggest potential spoilers, Iran and Hezbollah, are not parties to the deal. And yet they are Russia’s closest allies in propping up the Assad regime.

Whereas no one has yet demonstrated compelling evidence of a connection between Iraq and al Qaeda, Pakistan is known to be al Qaeda's new command center. Whereas Iran has funded the terrorist group Hizbollah, Pakistan is home to al Qaeda's leadership, and a number of terrorist groups—such as Harkat-ul-Mujahideen, Lashkar-e-Toiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, and others—have ""powerful links"" to Pakistan's military and intelligence agencies.

The Bush Administration has ignored all of this since Pakistan's leader, General Pervez Musharraf, has been cooperating in the war on terror. But Pakistani cooperation is less than complete: After 9/11 Pakistan failed to seal its border with Afghanistan, allowing many Taliban and al Qaeda leaders to escape U.S. forces. Worse, there have been reports that Pakistani officials have actively sought to mislead U.S. intelligence in order to protect al Qaeda operatives on Pakistani soil, and the government sent two Pakistani nuclear scientists to Myanmar after 9/11, evidently to avoid questioning by the CIA about nuclear information they may have given directly to Osama bin Laden. To make matters worse, Pakistan is not stable: Musharraf is seen by many Pakistanis as an American puppet, and any moment of weakness could leave him vulnerable to a coup by militant Islamic leaders.

In many sub-Saharan countries where governments are weak and poorly placed, religious entities are often the only organizations with a national reach. For these reasons and more, U.S. policymakers must come to grips with religion in new and more fruitful ways. Johnston recommends ways that the U.S. foreign policy apparatus can minimize the harm religion can do and, where possible, integrate a deeper religious understanding into both the development and the execution of its strategy. He calls for a group of “religion attachés,” similar to the labor attachés who have served in many U.S. embassies since the early days of the Cold War, and for teaching Foreign Service officers more about religion throughout their careers. The second recommendation seems more urgent; if political officers, heads of mission, and senior State Department personnel do not fully appreciate the importance of religion, then his proposed religion attachés are unlikely to be used well.",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2011-09-01/religion-terror-and-error-us-foreign-policy-and-challenges,development

"Timothy Heinemann, a retired Army colonel from Laguna Beach, California, does think strategically. He is also a veteran of Special Forces. I first met him in 2002 at the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where he was the dean of academics. He now runs Worldwide Impact, an NGO that helps ethnic groups, as well as a number of cross-border projects, particularly sending media teams into Burma to record the suffering there. Another kind of special operator, Heinemann, with his flip-flops and his engaging manner, embodies the subtle, indirect approach to managing conflict emphasized in the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review, one of the Pentagon’s primary planning documents. Heinemann says that he “privatizes condition-setting.” He explains: “We are networkers on both sides of the border. We try to find opportunities for NGOs to collaborate better in supporting ethnic groups’ needs. I do my small part to set conditions so that America can protect national, international, and humanitarian interests with real savvy. Our work is well known to various branches of the U.S. government. The opposition to the military dictatorship has no strategic and operational planning like Hezbollah does. Aung San Suu Kyi is little more than a symbol of the wrong issue—‘Democracy first!’ Ethnic rights and the balance of ethnic power are preconditions for democracy in Burma. These issues must be faced first, or little has been learned from the lessons of Afghanistan and Iraq.” Heinemann, like the Father of the White Monkey, also lives hand to mouth, grabbing grants and donations from wherever he can, and is sometimes reduced to financing trips himself.

It was on that basis that in his final years in office, Reagan fended off members of his administration—led by a young assistant secretary of state named Elliott Abrams—who wanted to invade Panama.

The Shia militant group Hezbollah, from neighboring Lebanon, has sent fighters and support into Syria to aid Assad's troops. Russia plans to ship several modern anti-aircraft missile systems to Syria, to deter foreign interference. Israel, meanwhile, is prepared to use force to stop the delivery of such systems, which it views as a threat.
