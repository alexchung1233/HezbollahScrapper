"Elected prime minister in 1992, Hariri pursued accommodation with Syria’s then-President Hafez al-Assad—Bashar’s father—who, under the so-called Pax Syriana, maintained tens of thousands of troops in postwar Lebanon. The occupation enriched Syrian generals and other insiders who controlled real-estate and import-export businesses, and enabled Syrian intelligence agents to watch for Sunni extremism brewing inside Palestinian refugee camps. It also allowed Syria to pursue a proxy war against Israel along Lebanon’s southern border, through Hezbollah—a source of leverage against the Jewish state as Syria presses for the eventual return of the Golan Heights. Hariri conceded control of Lebanon’s security to Assad, allowing a heavy troop presence and the penetration of Syrian intelligence agents into every sector of Lebanese life; in turn, Assad gave Hariri wide rein over the country’s economic development and postwar reconstruction.

"Perhaps the least bad outcome, all things considered, would be a negotiated settlement, in which Assad would turn over two or three members of his inner circle—high-profile leaders whose indictment would damage the regime politically—but receive immunity for himself and his brother. In return, he would need to pledge to keep Hezbollah on a tight leash, to chart a more moderate course at home and abroad, and to make comprehensive peace with Israel. Even this outcome would carry a bad stench, and be dismissed by many as a cynical ploy. But all things considered, it might do the least harm.

"Timothy Heinemann, a retired Army colonel from Laguna Beach, California, does think strategically. He is also a veteran of Special Forces. I first met him in 2002 at the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where he was the dean of academics. He now runs Worldwide Impact, an NGO that helps ethnic groups, as well as a number of cross-border projects, particularly sending media teams into Burma to record the suffering there. Another kind of special operator, Heinemann, with his flip-flops and his engaging manner, embodies the subtle, indirect approach to managing conflict emphasized in the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review, one of the Pentagon’s primary planning documents. Heinemann says that he “privatizes condition-setting.” He explains: “We are networkers on both sides of the border. We try to find opportunities for NGOs to collaborate better in supporting ethnic groups’ needs. I do my small part to set conditions so that America can protect national, international, and humanitarian interests with real savvy. Our work is well known to various branches of the U.S. government. The opposition to the military dictatorship has no strategic and operational planning like Hezbollah does. Aung San Suu Kyi is little more than a symbol of the wrong issue—‘Democracy first!’ Ethnic rights and the balance of ethnic power are preconditions for democracy in Burma. These issues must be faced first, or little has been learned from the lessons of Afghanistan and Iraq.” Heinemann, like the Father of the White Monkey, also lives hand to mouth, grabbing grants and donations from wherever he can, and is sometimes reduced to financing trips himself. He finds Burma “exotic, intoxicating.” ",https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/09/lifting-the-bamboo-curtain/306945/,Donation

"  Dedicated to the principle of establishing Greater Syria—which extends from the Euphrates to the Nile, an area that today includes Syria, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, and southeastern Turkey—the SSNP has little in common with the Shiite religious zealots of the Hizballah, who, operating from Iran to Lebanon, are trying to bring the kingdom of heaven down to earth, or with members of the Palestine Liberation Organization, who seek the redemption of their lost homeland at the end of a trail of blood.

If the Islamic Jihad or the PLO indirectly or even inadvertently advances the ""Syrian cause,"" the SSNP is glad to collaborate. But it will not support the Hizballah in its aim of founding an Islamic republic in Lebanon or help the PLO work toward the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, for these goals clash head-on with the SSNP's goal of a secular Syrian state. And while it supports the present Syrian government of President Hafez al-Assad as the fulcrum of power in Syria, the SSNP is wary of the regime's sectarian (Alawi) and socialist leanings and its support of pan-Arabism, which calls for an Arab state (as opposed to the Syrian state called for by the SSNP) spanning the area between the Atlantic Ocean and the Persian Gulf.

"It
 seems likely that states in the Middle East and North Africa could 
divide into three camps. The first, composed of Jordan, Morocco, and the
 small Gulf states, will do whatever they can to insulate themselves 
from the revolutionary and counterrevolutionary fray. In the second, 
Egypt and Tunisia will struggle to realize their revolutionary promise 
and ideals while resisting the counterrevolutionary forces of the old 
regimes. And, finally, there is the consortium of Saudi Arabia, Syria, 
Yemen (if President Saleh somehow manages to hold on), Algeria, Bahrain,
 and even an outlaw Libya, that all work -- not necessarily in concert 
--to contain and rollback democratic change. There have always been 
fissures and schisms among the Arab states, but never along these issues
 and alignments. The Middle East's two heavyweights -- revolutionary, 
struggling-to-be-democratic Egypt and status quo Saudi Arabia -- are 
likely to find one other at odds on a range of important issues 
including Hamas, Iran, Hizballah, and political change around the 
region. It is also possible that Egyptians, empowered by their 
revolution, will seek to support democracy activists elsewhere in the 
region. Many have already crossed the Libyan border in aid of the rebels
 there. Could they next turn their attention to, for example, Syria? 
Tunisians might seek to do the same in Algeria and Libya. This is not 
likely to sit well in Damascus, Algiers, and Tripoli, which would see 
regional democracy activists, and perhaps democracies themselves, as

Iran, for example, will continue to shore up Syria's Assad and Hezbollah as long as it fears military threats from Israel and the United States over its nuclear program. If those threats abate, and some kind of nuclear agreement is signed, it might just be possible for Kerry to also induce Tehran to separate itself from the Assad regime, thereby making a truce in the civil war easier.

"I don’t. The problem is, you’ve got an actor like ISIS, like Hezbollah, like Hamas, like AQAP, indeed like a lot of other violent non-state actors, and they don’t just do terrorism, they do a lot of different things. So by saying that they are “a terrorist organization,” you’re lumping together, first of all, so many disparate organizations, and second, you’re obscuring the fact that they might hold territory, like ISIS, or Hezbollah for that matter, or, in some instances, AQAP. And you’re obscuring the fact that they do other things, like sometimes they provide social services. So, if it’s a group that does nothing but terrorism, by and large, I think that the name fits. An example of that is the Abu Nidal organization in the ’70s and ’80s. It’s a Palestinian group, small, and that was all they did was organize acts of terrorism, they didn’t do anything else. Or the Black September organization would be a similar one. So I think that name is justified. And I’m not saying that the other groups are morally any better, but the name just doesn’t fit that well, to call them “a terrorist organization.” That’s not to say that ISIS doesn’t use terrorism—yes it does, obviously, to the extreme. So that’s just, in order not to confuse what are actors that have a whole lot more power than the name “terrorist organization” implies.",https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/history-terrorism-isis-9-11/405055/,Social Service
"Which brings us to a second question, one having to do with the nature of the man considering military action: would Netanyahu, a prime minister with an acute understanding of the essential role America plays in securing the existence of Israel (Netanyahu is a graduate of both Cheltenham High School, outside Philadelphia, and MIT, and is the most Americanized prime minister in Israel’s history, more so even than the Milwaukee-raised Golda Meir), actually take a chance on permanently alienating American affection in order to make a high-risk attempt at stopping Iran? If Iran retaliates against American troops in Iraq or Afghanistan, the consequences for Israel’s relationship with America’s military leadership could be catastrophic. (Of course, Netanyahu would be risking more than his relationship with the United States: a strike on Iran, Israeli intelligence officials believe, could provoke all-out retaliation by Iran’s Lebanese subsidiary, Hezbollah, which now possesses, by most intelligence estimates, as many as 45,000 rockets—at least three times as many as it had in the summer of 2006, during the last round of fighting between the group and Israel.)

"The first is that Israel would get only one try. Israeli planes would fly low over Saudi Arabia, bomb their targets in Iran, and return to Israel by flying again over Saudi territory, possibly even landing in the Saudi desert for refueling—perhaps, if speculation rife in intelligence circles is to be believed, with secret Saudi cooperation. These planes would have to return home quickly, in part because Israeli intelligence believes that Iran would immediately order Hezbollah to fire rockets at Israeli cities, and Israeli air-force resources would be needed to hunt Hezbollah rocket teams.

Recalling the presence of Palestinian militias in pre-civil-war Lebanon, Derbas and other senior level officials have repeatedly warned of disastrous consequences should Syrians in Lebanon take up arms against the state. Although some Syrians have been involved in terrorist attacks and some opposition fighters are present among the refugee population, there is little evidence to suggest a wide-scale rebellion against the state. Even though the Syrian war has triggered a number of battles around the country—including routine clashes in Tripoli, the June 2013 battle of Sidon, and the summer 2014 clashes in Arsal—most refugees are preoccupied with basic subsistence needs. Parts of Tripoli are riddled with extreme poverty, and Arsal's location on the periphery of the Lebanese state has meant it has long been overlooked in terms of infrastructure and other basic needs. In Abra, which is near Sidon, political tension between the marginalized Sunni community and Hezbollah had been growing for some time. The Syrian civil war acted as the tipping point, but socio-economic factors cannot be ignored.",https://en.annahar.com/article/206839-lebanons-refugee-dilemma,Infrastructure

"The news came on November 4 in the form of three back-to-back developments in a mere 10 hours. First, Saad Hariri, Lebanon’s prime minister, announced his resignation. That he made the statement from Riyadh told much of the story; that he delivered it with the genuineness of one forced to read his own prison sentence told the rest. The decision was announced by the Lebanese prime minister but it was made in Saudi Arabia. Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince and de facto leader, had reason to want it to happen. Saudi-Iranian tensions are rising and bin Salman is determined to depict Tehran as the source of all regional evils. For Hariri to preside over a government that includes Hezbollah fundamentally undercut that core message: It meant allowing one of Riyadh’s closest allies to cooperate with Tehran’s most loyal partner. Hariri as prime minister created the impression that coexistence with Hezbollah and by extension with Iran was possible; his departure is designed to erase any doubt. He was asked to assume the prime ministership a year ago, at a time when the goal was to inoculate Lebanon from Saudi-Iranian rivalry; with him gone, Lebanon now is fully exposed to it.

This was not the first missile that the Houthis, a Yemeni rebel group enjoying Iranian and Hezbollah support, had fired at its northern neighbor, but its timing and unprecedented range could make it one of the more consequential. The extent of outside backing to the Houthis is a matter of some debate, though neither U.S. nor Saudi officials harbor any doubt that the dramatic progress in the rebel movement’s ballistic missile program could not have occurred without its two benefactors’ considerable training and help. Like Hariri in his act of self-immolation, Saudi officials quickly and publicly drew a direct line connecting the strike to Iran and Hezbollah; it was, they proclaimed, an act of war for which they held both responsible and to which they would respond.",https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/11/lebanon-saudi-iran-hezbollah/545306/,Airport

"Which brings us to a second question, one having to do with the nature of the man considering military action: would Netanyahu, a prime minister with an acute understanding of the essential role America plays in securing the existence of Israel (Netanyahu is a graduate of both Cheltenham High School, outside Philadelphia, and MIT, and is the most Americanized prime minister in Israel’s history, more so even than the Milwaukee-raised Golda Meir), actually take a chance on permanently alienating American affection in order to make a high-risk attempt at stopping Iran? If Iran retaliates against American troops in Iraq or Afghanistan, the consequences for Israel’s relationship with America’s military leadership could be catastrophic. (Of course, Netanyahu would be risking more than his relationship with the United States: a strike on Iran, Israeli intelligence officials believe, could provoke all-out retaliation by Iran’s Lebanese subsidiary, Hezbollah, which now possesses, by most intelligence estimates, as many as 45,000 rockets—at least three times as many as it had in the summer of 2006, during the last round of fighting between the group and Israel.)

At the same time, the Iraqi President was observed to be repairing his links to other leading terrorists—George Habbash, Nayef Hawatmeh, Ahmed Jibril, and the organization Hizbollah, fifteen of whose members Saddam Hussein brought back to Iraq from a Kuwaiti prison after Iraq invaded.

"Hezbollah is, of course, genuinely popular within the Shia community. Its message that it has protected the country against threats, both from Israel and from Syrian jihadists alike, rings true for many of its voters, who also see Nasrallah as devoid of corruption, unlike the rest of the crooked political establishment. But the political resources at Hezbollah’s disposal, which include a construction arm and a foundation to support families whose sons have been killed fighting under its flag, dwarf those of the other parties. The weakness of the Lebanese state also provides Hezbollah with a trump card, allowing it to portray itself as the only power that can protect its supporters from internal and external enemies. These accumulated advantages have left those running against the party to question whether there is any governance failure large enough to cause Hezbollah to lose an election. “They’re using the sectarian card, they’re trying to bring all the Shia together to follow them,” Yaghi said. “They’re taking people who are hungry and paying them, and they have weapons and money that nobody else has.”",https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/05/lebanon-election-hezbollah-sunni-shia/559772/,Construction

The group’s original sin, he said, was entering politics in 1992—it should have simply left the messy business of governance to others. “We’re not against Hezbollah as a resistance, so long as it resists in the right way,” he said. “Our quarrel with them is development.

In 2005, Israel unilaterally pulled its soldiers and settlers out of Gaza. Again, rockets followed.

"Even as America worries about Iraq's Shiite-Sunni divide, a similar fault line threatens Saudi Arabia, according to a new report from the International Crisis Group. The kingdom's two million Shiites account for only 10 to 15 percent of the population, but they are concentrated in the Eastern Province, which is close to Iraq and home to the country's largest oil fields and processing facilities. Saudi Arabia's Sunni monarchs have long pursued policies intended ""simultaneously to pacify and marginalize"" the Shiite population: encouraging Sunnis to resettle in the Eastern Province, seizing the property and merchandise of Shiite merchants, and imposing restrictions on Shiite religious observances. Shiite clerics have generally responded by urging distance from political matters and quiet, gradual attempts to bring about reform. The report notes, however, that a Saudi branch of Hizbollah was founded in 1987 and continues to operate, and that thirteen Saudi Shiites were indicted for their alleged role in the 1996 bombing of the Khobar Towers. It adds that many Saudi Sunnis think their Shiite countrymen are ""biding their time, banking on external support—U.S. or other—to establish their own independent state."" The risk of violent confrontation is currently low, the report concludes, but this relative calm brings its own danger—that the Saudi government will feel little pressure to take actions that might pre-empt a more militant, destabilizing Shiism.",https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/12/primary-sources/304409/,Home

Two researchers think that those services are a key to the group’s success—and to its deadliness. Like many other terror outfits, including Hamas and the Taliban, Hezbollah works like a club, requiring membership dues in the form of religious observances. The authors point out that in the shadow war of insurgency, such clubs face no greater danger than defection.

This loyalty is reinforced when the club provides benefits like education, health care, and security. With less fear of defection, clubs can more confidently attack high-value targets and are more likely to use suicide bombers. The authors note that Hamas, which offers social services to Palestinians, averages 5.9 fatalities per attack. Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which shares Hamas’s jihadist ideology but not its commitment to welfare, averages only 2.9.

") that the strategy behind suicide bombings is to shrink the space in which Israelis feel safe, so that ultimately life in Israel just isn't worth living. As buses and malls are avoided because of the danger, restaurants and shops become the next targets. Then it will be schools, hotels, ad infinitum. What he describes is a war. And no matter what the United States seems to want to believe, it is not just Hamas, it is a consortium of groups with the same goal and the same tactic. It is no different from Germany, Italy, and Japan sixty years ago. They had mutual interests, common enemies, and similar tactics. They didn't have to talk to or conspire with one another to know that the efforts of each contributed to the benefit of all. As it was with them, it is with the Palestinian Authority, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Hizbollah, Fatah, and so forth. Did other nations sympathetic to Germany's cause have to declare war against the Allies? No, of course not. They could stay neutral, even make noises in support of the Allies and peace, while secretly financing and supporting the Nazi effort. But if Germany prevailed, they would share in the fruits of victory. Thus it is with Syria, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and the PA, newly proclaimed by President Bush to be peace-lovers and not the problem. They will talk the talk to please Bush, but never walk the walk. A cease-fire? Sure, while Israel eases up, surrenders property, disrupts the lives of Israeli loyalists (particularly Israeli displaced settlers ethnically cleansed from the new Palestinian state), and abandons its moral and military superiority. A cease-fire? Yes, but only after Hamas ceases to exist; after Yasir Arafat dies a natural death; after the PA recognizes Israel and Jews and allows Jews to live in peace wherever they live, even within their bloodstained, extorted new nation; after Syria stops supporting Hizbollah; and after our friends the Saudis stop fomenting hatred and financing and housing terrorists. Until those things happen, the war rages on, no matter what artificial or natural lulls occur. In other words, a cease-fire? Never again!

The Iranian-backed Hezbollah movement made gains in Lebanon's parliamentary vote. The radical Muslim Brotherhood showed electoral strength in Egypt.

"Marine Major William Truax said it best—in a recent letter from his position on the staff of the multinational headquarters in Baghdad—when he observed, ""The bad guys did us a huge favor by gathering together in one place and trying to make a stand. It allowed us to focus on them … there rather than hunt them down in their home countries."" If Fallows needs any reinforcement of this point, consider that the interim Iraqi Prime Minister, Ayad Allawi, told both the UN and Congress that more than half the terrorists in Iraq—not militants, insurgents, or freedom fighters but terrorists—are from foreign countries, principally Jordan, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Chechnya, and Afghanistan, and from groups such as the PLO, Hamas, and Hizbollah.

"They’re both right. As Paul suggests, Reagan was far more skeptical of direct military intervention than today’s conservatives remember. He sent U.S. ground troops into harm’s way twice in eight years: to invade Grenada, a country with roughly 500 troops, and to serve as peacekeepers in Lebanon, a mission he quickly aborted after a Hezbollah bomber killed 241 of them. The year after those interventions, as Paul notes, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger laid out a series of tests for military force—later popularized by Colin Powell—that essentially ruled out any intervention where public support, and decisive victory, could not be guaranteed. It was on that basis that in his final years in office, Reagan fended off members of his administration—led by a young assistant secretary of state named Elliott Abrams—who wanted to invade Panama. Even then, Reagan left the White House haunted by the belief that he had intervened too much. His final words in the Oval Office, according to Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, were “the worst thing I ever did was send those troops to Beirut.”",https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/07/what-would-reagan-do-in-iraq/374391/,House

"Iraq aside, what country poses the greatest threat to American national security? North Korea? Iran? Syria? According to a recent report by the Cato Institute, it's Pakistan, our ""frontline ally"" in the war on terror. Whereas no one has yet demonstrated compelling evidence of a connection between Iraq and al Qaeda, Pakistan is known to be al Qaeda's new command center. Whereas Iran has funded the terrorist group Hizbollah, Pakistan is home to al Qaeda's leadership, and a number of terrorist groups—such as Harkat-ul-Mujahideen, Lashkar-e-Toiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, and others—have ""powerful links"" to Pakistan's military and intelligence agencies. And whereas North Korea will soon have perhaps two nuclear missiles, Pakistan may already have nearly fifty, and the material necessary to build an arsenal of 100. (Pakistan is also known to have provided nuclear technology to North Korea, even after 9/11.) The Bush Administration has ignored all of this since Pakistan's leader, General Pervez Musharraf, has been cooperating in the war on terror. But Pakistani cooperation is less than complete: After 9/11 Pakistan failed to seal its border with Afghanistan, allowing many Taliban and al Qaeda leaders to escape U.S. forces. Worse, there have been reports that Pakistani officials have actively sought to mislead U.S. intelligence in order to protect al Qaeda operatives on Pakistani soil, and the government sent two Pakistani nuclear scientists to Myanmar after 9/11, evidently to avoid questioning by the CIA about nuclear information they may have given directly to Osama bin Laden. To make matters worse, Pakistan is not stable: Musharraf is seen by many Pakistanis as an American puppet, and any moment of weakness could leave him vulnerable to a coup by militant Islamic leaders. This could ""instantly transfer control of Pakistan's nuclear assets to a new regime with unknown intentions."" ",https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2003/06/primary-sources/302746/,Home

"Huh. So going back to 2000, Chuck Hagel opposed all those steps that the United States ended up taking anyway. And what did ""the mainstream"" accomplish while Hagel was outside of it? What wonderful things occurred as a result of all the measures Hagel opposed even as they passed? Well, thanks to President Bush's refusal to talk with Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian people finally understood that terrorism would get them nowhere and started pursuing a lasting peace as never before. Meanwhile, Hamas and Hezbollah, similarly chastened by America's refusal to talk directly, dissolved their respective organizations and never again bothered our allies, preferring to dedicate themselves to charity work. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, having been labeled a terrorist organization, was annihilated by SEAL Team Six. And the 2008 sanctions bill caused Iran to rescind its declaration that America is the great Satan, meanwhile giving up any desire to enrich uranium and helping America to build a peaceful Iraq.

"But the truth remains that as a public relations matter, the Gaza war was disastrous, because Israeli politicians never seem to consider, when making strategic decisions, that their country will always be held to a higher standard, and even to a double-standard. The cynics of Hamas and Hezbollah know that civilian deaths on their side benefit their cause politically, which is one of the reasons they fire rockets from schoolyards, as I've seen with my own eyes in Gaza. So it is Israel's job to minimize civilian casualties, not only because that's what a civilized country does, but because civilian casualties undermine Israel's legitimacy with people who sit in particularly harsh judgment of the world's only Jewish country.",https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2010/01/did-hamas-win/32912/,School

" ... No doubt, because of his immediate experiences, Hasan came to
believe a disproportionate number of people who went to war came home
as basket cases. It seems quite likely that he was scared witless by
this, scared beyond the breaking point. It is entirely possible that he
was more terrified than terrorist. But... There remains the attraction of jihadi theology. You can't rule it
out of the calculus. And yes, there is the eternal question of whether
Islam is fundamentally different from other religions because Mohammed
was the only prophet to personally take up the sword. (Our boy, Moses,
had Yahweh take up the sword for him.) You can't dismiss this evil. I
have no patience for those who would deny that we're in a long-term
struggle against some really bad actors who need to be wiped out. I'm
in favor of the campaign against Al Qaeda. I'm in favor of the
Predators. I'm in favor of Israel's right to defend itself, within the
limits of reason, by taking proportionate action against Hamas in Gaza
and by seizing arms shipments from Iran intended to bolster Hizballah. In any case, I find myself too entangled in the horrific complications
of the case to be able to label it, simply, as an act of jihad. ",https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2009/11/joe-klein-and-i-argue-sort-of-about-nidal-hasan/30293/,Home
