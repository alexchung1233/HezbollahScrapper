{"text": "As head of Lebanon\u2019s pro-Syrian parliamentary bloc, Hezbollah wields tremendous sway over the direction and stability of the government. The Hezbollah-led parliamentary coalition\u2014referred to as March 8\u2014has held 57 of Lebanon\u2019s 128 parliamentary seats since the 2009 elections. After Lebanon elected Hezbollah ally Michel Aoun to the presidency in October 2016, March 8 received 17 of 30 cabinet positions, thus cementing Hezbollah\u2019s continued influence in the country."},
{"text": "Meanwhile, Hezbollah\u2019s military entanglements in Syria and with Israel risk drawing all of Lebanon into regional conflicts. Although the United Nations has tasked Lebanon\u2019s military with supervising Hezbollah\u2019s disarmament, Hezbollah has managed to build up its military capabilities and presence in Lebanon under the watchful gaze of the Lebanese army. Hezbollah and the Lebanese military have also coordinated against Syrian rebel groups."},
{"text": "Hezbollah has also created its own parallel institutions within Lebanon\u2019s educational, social, and economic sectors. Hezbollah-run schools indoctrinate Shiite youth while its network of social services provide Shiite citizens with health care, utilities, groceries, and construction services. But because of international sanctions, Hezbollah-linked hospitals, charities, and other businesses risk inviting devastating economic sanctions. International aid organizations wary of inviting sanctions must also navigate around Hezbollah when partnering with local Lebanese organizations. International sanctions targeting Hezbollah have also complicated the Lebanese economy due to Hezbollah\u2019s involvement in the Lebanese business sector."},
{"text": "In this report, CEP tracks the history of Hezbollah\u2019s entrenchment into Lebanese society and highlights the widespread influence Hezbollah has accrued in virtually every major Lebanese sector. Hezbollah\u2019s integration into Lebanon threatens the country\u2019s stability and regional and international security."},

As a result, Hezbollah has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, Canada, Australia, the European Union, and several other countries and intergovernmental organizations, including the Arab League."},

{"text": "While Hezbollah\u2019s involvement in these specific political assassinations has not been proven, Hezbollah has been documented using violence to further its political goals. In May 2008, Hezbollah launched bloody street battles against Lebanese forces after a government decision to dismantle the group\u2019s private telephone network, which Hezbollah called a declaration of war."},
{"text": "Hezbollah has directly engaged in violence against Lebanese citizens on a smaller scale as well. Hezbollah reportedly maintains non-sectarian military units in Sunni and Christian areas to maintain security, particularly in southern Lebanon where government security forces are not as active."},
{"text": "With Iranian training and financing, Hezbollah regularly attacked Israeli forces during Israel\u2019s 18-year occupation from 1982 through 2000. Notable confrontations include the Grapes of Wrath operation, a 16-day conflict with Hezbollah in April 1996 in response to a wave of deadly attacks on Israeli soldiers in Lebanon and rockets into Israeli territory."},
{"text": "The war devastated Lebanon, leaving 130,000 Lebanese homes destroyed and tens of thousands of people homeless."},
{"text": "Although Israel and Hezbollah have declared their desire to avoid a new war, Hezbollah has repeatedly issued several statements threatening a new conflict. In February 2016, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah threatened to strike Israel\u2019s ammonia storage facility in Haifa, which would have the effect of a nuclear blast, according to Israeli experts."},
{"text": "A new regional war would have devastating consequences for both Lebanese and Israelis. In 2017, Israeli military officials spoke publicly about plans to evacuate northern Israeli communities during the next confrontation with Hezbollah. One former IDF officer expressed hope that the Lebanese government was making the same contingency plans, predicting that the \u201cnext war will be pretty bloody for both sides.\u201d"},

Because Lebanon\u2019s parliamentary system often requires opposing parties to join in political coalitions, Hezbollah has been a staple in Lebanese coalitions since 2008, giving the group influence over the stability, direction, and makeup of Lebanon\u2019s government.

{"text": "A key point of contention between Hezbollah\u2019s supporters and detractors in the Lebanese government is the party\u2019s continued possession of weaponry in defiance of international resolutions.

In April 2017, Hariri lambasted Israeli strikes against Hezbollah in Syria and described quarrels with Hezbollah as a \u201cpolitical dispute\u201d that \u201cdoesn\u2019t affect the management of the country.\u201d"},
