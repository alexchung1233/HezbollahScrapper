"Iran, however, is a strong hardened military power by any standard. It has a large, motivated, experienced army and considerable expertise in asymmetrical warfare and local weapons production, and it retains a strong political will to sacrifice its troops for a cause. This strength is supported by a vast network of allies and agents in Arab Shiite communities, starting with Hezbollah in Lebanon and including the Alawites and their allies in Syria, the newly empowered Iraqi Shiite, and the underprivileged among the Gulf Arab Shiite. The Iranians have a lot of cards to play with here. Iran does not need to physically conquer the Gulf with its armies to achieve its objectives. The mullahs have mastered the game of proxy control under the guise of local Shiite communities and organizations. In southern Iraq, Iran has this type of infrastructure already in place. These forces can easily cross GCC borders at the slightest provocation, in what could be packaged as a “popular” Iraqi movement of people across borders to save their distressed Shiite brethren in Arabia. In such a scenario, one certain to create massive geopolitical confusion, the U.S. will hardly allow itself to become stuck in the middle of what it will probably see as a Muslim civil war.

"The arrest by the Saudis of two suspected jihadists operating inside the Kingdom and planning attacks via sophisticated communications suggests several conclusions. One is regarding their nationalities. One culprit is from Yemen, and the other is from Chad but residing in Saudi Arabia. This fact shows that al-Qaeda personnel, volunteers or supporters do not necessarily operate in “national clusters.” As much previous evidence has shown for years, if not for decades by now, there is an international network of followers of a radical doctrine whose members hail from as many countries as the indoctrination machine can reach. After the attacks of September 11, the most popularized slogan in U.S. counterterrorism commentary was that 14 of the 19 perpetrators were “Saudis.” But years later, it was clear that the Jihadists have no specific “nationality” or “ethnicity.” They operate where they can with what they have. As I argued in my book The War of Ideas in 2007, the ideology of al-Qaeda does not recognize countries and national boundaries. A Chadian was recruited to prepare an attack against the United States out of Saudi Arabia. A Nigerian was indoctrinated by a Yemeni to strike in Detroit. U.S. citizens were mobilized to strike in Somalia, and an Egyptian leads the world’s terrorist network. There are no local agendas in Yemen or in Mauritania that are producing the international brand of Jihadi terrorists.

In fact, a victory for the Jihadists will exacerbate such problems. The developments in Afghanistan, Tunisia, Libya and now Egypt are striking examples. Living under the other type of Terror, Khomeinism in Iran or Hezbollah in Lebanon is another example of the failure of these violent doctrines.

This faction pursues this approach by fabricating the lie that it represents an entity that is far from sectarian, and sides “with legitimacy and sovereignty” against sectarian takfirists who oppose this legitimacy and sovereignty. From this point, this same sectarian faction is now encouraging a new generation of Maronite Christian “facades” to present their “credentials” for the presidential elections scheduled for next year, based on their support of the elimination of Assir, the siege of Aarsal, and Hezbollah’s project and actions at home and abroad.",https://english.alarabiya.net/en/views/news/middle-east/2013/06/29/Behind-Lebanon-s-manhunt-for-Sheikh-Assir.html,Home

The Dumfries & Galloway Constabulary along with The FBI directed the investigation. Scotland provided the forum for suit. In 2003, Libyan leader Moammar Qaddafi accepted responsibility and paid compensation to the victims’ families.

The mullahs have mastered the game of proxy control under the guise of local Shiite communities and organizations. In southern Iraq, Iran has this type of infrastructure already in place.
