"On July 2009, a huge blast struck Lebanese village of Khirbet Selm, when an abandoned house — containing a stockpile of rockets, automatic weapons and ammunition that belonged to Hezbollah — exploded in a massive inferno. The incident exposed how the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), as well as the LAF supposedly patrolling the area with a directive to enforce Resolution 1701 to disarm any Hezbollah militia, had failed in their mission. With Israeli IDF having estimated 160 villages across southern Lebanon contained Hezbollah military supplies, whilst carrying out 400 vehicles and air patrols a day, it seems strange that none of the UNIFIL and LAF combined patrols came across any sign of Hezbollah’s arms caches.",http://english.alarabiya.net/en/features/2017/11/18/ANALYSIS-Understanding-Iran-and-Hezbollah-s-desires-for-Lebanon.html,House

The Iranians have a lot of cards to play with here. Iran does not need to physically conquer the Gulf with its armies to achieve its objectives. The mullahs have mastered the game of proxy control under the guise of local Shiite communities and organizations. In southern Iraq, Iran has this type of infrastructure already in place. These forces can easily cross GCC borders at the slightest provocation, in what could be packaged as a “popular” Iraqi movement of people across borders to save their distressed Shiite brethren in Arabia. In such a scenario, one certain to create massive geopolitical confusion, the U.S. will hardly allow itself to become stuck in the middle of what it will probably see as a Muslim civil war.

One is regarding their nationalities. One culprit is from Yemen, and the other is from Chad but residing in Saudi Arabia. This fact shows that al-Qaeda personnel, volunteers or supporters do not necessarily operate in “national clusters.” As much previous evidence has shown for years, if not for decades by now, there is an international network of followers of a radical doctrine whose members hail from as many countries as the indoctrination machine can reach. After the attacks of September 11, the most popularized slogan in U.S. counterterrorism commentary was that 14 of the 19 perpetrators were “Saudis.” But years later, it was clear that the Jihadists have no specific “nationality” or “ethnicity.” They operate where they can with what they have. As I argued in my book The War of Ideas in 2007, the ideology of al-Qaeda does not recognize countries and national boundaries. A Chadian was recruited to prepare an attack against the United States out of Saudi Arabia. A Nigerian was indoctrinated by a Yemeni to strike in Detroit. U.S. citizens were mobilized to strike in Somalia, and an Egyptian leads the world’s terrorist network. There are no local agendas in Yemen or in Mauritania that are producing the international brand of Jihadi terrorists. Rather, it is a radical, systemic, totalitarian doctrine that is using – and often abusing – causes, grievances and historical conflicts. A victory for this ideology and its supporters and promoters will not solve the problems of the peoples oppressed under their regimes. In fact, a victory for the Jihadists will exacerbate such problems. The developments in Afghanistan, Tunisia, Libya and now Egypt are striking examples. Living under the other type of Terror, Khomeinism in Iran or Hezbollah in Lebanon is another example of the failure of these violent doctrines. The al-Qaeda threat is global, and Washington learned about it one more time last week as a result of intercepted messages between Zawahiri and Wuhaishi, possibly during a conference call of Terror leaders.
